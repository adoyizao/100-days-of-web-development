Day 1 of Worthy's Vue's 100 DWDC!

I forked Worthy's heart loader animation repo and PLAYED around, trying to understand the code and what certain lines did.
I was able to tweak the animation from rotation to translation.

Not a coder, so this was VERY stressful :'(  learning Git, GitHub, VSCode, and then making sense of code i'd never seen before; all in day one. **phew
I guess that's what makes it a challenge.

Really appreciate this Day 1; here we go, Day 2! :)
